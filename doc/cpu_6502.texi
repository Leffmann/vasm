microprocessor family. It also supports the Rockwell/WDC 65C02,
the Hudson Soft HuC6280 and the WDC 65802/65816 instruction sets.

@section Additional options for this module

This module provides the following additional options:

@table @option
    @item -6280
        Recognize all HuC6280 instructions.
    @item -802
        Same as @option{-816}. There is no difference in the instruction set.
    @item -816
        Enables the 8/16 bit instruction set for the WDC65816/65802 and
        additional directives to switch loading of the accumulator and/or
        the index register between 8 and 16 bits.
        The target address size is 24 bits.
    @item -bbcade
        Swap meaning of @code{<} and @code{>} unary operators for compatibility
        with the BBC ADE assembler.
    @item -c02
        Recognize all 65C02 instructions. This excludes DTV (@option{-dtv})
        and illegal (@option{-illegal}) instructions.
    @item -ce02
        Enables the Commodore CSG65CE02 instruction set, which extends on
        the WDC02 instruction set.
    @item -dtv
        Recognize the three additional C64-DTV instructions.
    @item -illegal
        Allow 'illegal' 6502 instructions to be recognized.
    @item -mega65
        Enables the 45GS02 instruction set for the MEGA65 computer.
    @item -opt-branch
        Enables translation of @code{B<cc>} branches into sequences of
        @code{B<!cc> *+5 ; JMP label} when necessary. @code{BRA} (DTV, 65C02)
        is directly translated into a @code{JMP} when out of range.
        It also performs optimization of @code{JMP} to @code{BRA},
        whenever possible.
    @item -wdc02
        Recognize all 65C02 instructions and the WDC65C02 extensions
        (@code{RMB},@code{SMB},@code{BBR},@code{BBS},@code{STP},@code{WAI)}.

@section General

This backend accepts 6502 family instructions as described in
the instruction set reference manuals from MOS and Rockwell, which are valid
for the following CPUs: 6502 - 6518, 6570, 6571, 6702, 7501, 8500, 8502.

Optionally accepts 65C02 family instructions as described in the
instruction set reference manuals from Rockwell and WDC. Also supports
the WDC extensions in the W65C02 and W65C134.

Optionally accepts 65CE02 family instructions as described in the
instruction set reference manuals from Commodore Semiconductor Group.

Optionally accepts HuC6280 instructions as described in the instruction
set reference manuals from Hudson Soft.

Optionally accepts 45GS02 instructions as defined by the Mega65 project.

Optionally accepts WDC65816 insructions as described in the Programming
Manual by The Western Design Center.

The target address type is 16 bits, or 24 bits in WDC65816 mode.

Instructions consist of one up to three bytes for the standard 6502 family
(up to 7 bytes for the 6280) and require no alignment.
There is also no alignment requirement for sections and data.

All known mnemonics for illegal instructions are optionally recognized (e.g.
@code{dcm} and @code{dcp} refer to the same instruction). Some illegal
insructions (e.g. @code{$ab}) are known to show unpredictable behaviour,
or do not always work the same on different CPUs.

Note that the WDC65816 @code{MVN} and @code{MVP} block move instructions
require a full 24-bit address (or a label) for the source and destination,
as documented in WDC's Programming Manual. This assembler additionally
allows to specify the bank byte directly, which is triggered by a constant
value between 0 and 255.

@section Extensions

This backend provides the following specific extensions:

@itemize @minus

@item The parser understands a lo/hi-modifier to select low- or high-byte
 of a 16-bit word. The character @code{<} is used to select the low-byte
 and @code{>} for the high-byte. It has to be the first character before
 an expression. See also option @option{-bbcade}.
 In WDC65816 mode the character @code{^} can be used to select the
 bank-byte (bits 16 to 23) of a full 24 bit address.

@item When applying the operation @code{>>8}, @code{/256}, @code{%256}
 or @code{&256} on a label, an appropriate lo/hi-byte relocation will
 automatically be generated.

@item The hi/lo-modifier can also be used in front of absolute addressing
 modes, to enforce absolute 16-bit addressing (hi/@code{>}) or
 zero/direct-page 8-bit addressing (lo/@code{<}).
 In WDC65816 mode the @code{>} character selects full 24-bit addressing
 instead, and @code{!} or @code{|} may be used to enforce 16-bit addressing.

@end itemize

This backend extends the selected syntax module by the following
directives:

@table @code
@item <symbol> ezp <expr>
      Works exactly like the @code{equ} directive, but marks <symbol>
      as a zero page symbol and use zero page addressing whenever
      <symbol> is used in a memory addressing mode.

@item a8
      Declares that immediate instructions loading the accumulator
      read 8 bits (default, WDC65816 only).

@item a16
      Declares that immediate instructions loading the accumulator
      read 16 bits (WDC65816 only).

@item setdp <expr>
      Set the current base address of the zero/direct page for
      optimizations from absolute to zero-page addressing modes.
      Example: set it to @code{$2000} for the HuC6280/PC-Engine.

@item x8
      Declares that immediate instructions loading the index registers
      read 8 bits (default, WDC65816 only).

@item x16
      Declares that immediate instructions loading the index registers
      read 16 bits (WDC65816 only).

@item zero
      Switch to a zero page section called @code{zero} or @code{.zero},
      which has the type @code{bss} with attributes @code{"aurw"}.
      Accesses to symbols from this section will default to zero page
      addressing mode.

@item zpage <symbol1> [,<symbol2>...]
      Mark symbols as zero page and use zero page addressing for
      expressions based on this symbol, unless overridden by a
      hi-modifier (@code{>}).
@end table

All these directives are also available in the form starting with a
dot (@code{.}).

@section Optimizations

This backend performs the following operand optimizations and translations:

@itemize @minus

@item Absolute addressing modes are optimized to zero-page (or direct-page)
  addressing modes, whenever possible.
@item An absolute addressing mode will be promoted to long addressing
  (24 bits) for the WDC65816, when needed.
@item Conditional branches, where the destination is out of range, are
  translated into @code{B<!cc> *+5} and an absolute @code{JMP} instruction
  (@option{-opt-branch}).
@item Some CPUs also allow optimization of @code{JMP} to @code{BRA},
  when @option{-opt-branch} was given.
