This chapter describes the TOS output module, which can be
selected with option @option{-Ftos} to generate executable Atari TOS
executable files, or with option{-Fdri} to generate DRI-format object
files.

@section Legal

    This module is written in 2009-2016,2020,2021,2023 by Frank Wille and
    is covered by the vasm copyright without modifications.

@section Additional options for this module

All these options only have an effect in executable files.
@table @option
    @item -monst
        Write Devpac "MonST"-compatible symbols.
    @item -stdsymbols
        Do not write HiSoft extended symbol names. Cut at 8 characters.
    @item -tos-flags=<flags>
        Sets the flags field in the TOS file header. Defaults to 0.
        Overwrites a TOS flags definition in the assembler source.
@end table

@section General

@table @option
  @item -Ftos
    The TOS executable file format is used on Atari 16/32-bit computers
    with 68000 up to 68060 CPU running any TOS, MiNT or any compatible
    operating system. The symbol table is in DRI format and may use
    HiSoft extended symbol names.
  @item -Fdri
    The object file format defined by Digital Research for Atari M68k
    systems.
@end table

@section Restrictions

@itemize @minus
@item These file formats only support a single Text (code), Data and BSS
  section.
@item For @code{tos} all symbols must be defined, otherwise the generation
  of the executable fails. Unknown symbols are listed by vasm.
@item The only relocations allowed in @code{tos} are 32-bit absolute. For
  @code{dri} all 16- and 32-bit absolute and PC-relative relocations
  are supported. 16-bit base-relative appears as a 16-bit absolute symbol
  reference.
@item The maximum symbol length is 8 characters only. The @code{tos}
  format increases the maximum length to 22 by using an extension
  created by HiSoft, unless forbidden by @option{-stdsymbols}.
@item Symbol references in @code{dri} object files are limited to a
  maximum of 8192 symbols.
@end itemize
All these restrictions are defined by the file format itself.
